<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Basic Authentication Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://convale.github.io/TOP-BasicAuth/)

A quickly deployable user authenticated website. It helps you hit the ground running without any of the fluff. It's build with Node/Express as the backend server, pug for views, passport/bcrypyt for authentication, and MongoDB for the database. It's a barbones implementation, so you can get set up quickly and adapt it however you'd prefer.

For the dev dependencies, it's currently loaded with dotenv for environmetal variables and nodemon for continously deploying saved items.

This is part of The ODIN Project's Fullstack Javascript Bootcamp to teach budding web developers the basics.
